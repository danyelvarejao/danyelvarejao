## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm <b>Danyel</b> - A Full Stack Web Develoer from Brazil that loves technology in general.


<b>More about me:</b>
Curious about how everything works and how it's made, I went to find out how the game called <b>"Tibia"</b> was made. Around 2010 I had my first contact with programming, in which I started building systems/mods for the game <b>"Tibia"</b> using <b>C++</b> and <b>LUA</b>, and I continue to do so until today.

I love using <b>VIM</b> as my text editor.

<b>Learning at the moment:</b>
- ReactJS and NextJS
- Styled Components
- tailwindCSS
- Prism
- tRPC
