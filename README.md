## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm <b>Danyel</b> - A Full Stack Developer from Brazil that loves technology in general.


<b>More about me:</b>
Curious about how stuff works "under the hood" in a game I used to play called <b>"Tibia"</b> I discovered a passion for technology and software development, my first contact was building mods for the game using <b>C++</b> and <b>LUA</b>, a hobby I still enjoy nowadays.

I love using <b>VIM</b> as my text editor.
